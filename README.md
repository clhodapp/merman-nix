# merman-nix

Nix packaging of [merman](https://github.com/Latias94/merman), a
headless Rust implementation of mermaid. It ships two binaries:
`merman-cli`, a renderer that takes mermaid source and writes SVG or
PNG without a browser, and `merman-lsp`, a mermaid language server.

merman is not in nixpkgs, so this flake packages it and exports the
result as an overlay.

## Use it

```sh
nix run github:clhodapp/merman-nix -- mmdc -i diagram.mmd -o diagram.svg
```

As a flake input:

```nix
{
  inputs.merman-nix.url = "github:clhodapp/merman-nix";

  # the package:
  #   inputs.merman-nix.packages.${system}.merman
  # or through the overlay, landing at pkgs.merman.merman:
  #   nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.merman-nix.overlays.packages ];
}
```

`merman-cli` implements the `mmdc` interface that mermaid-cli defines,
so it substitutes for `mmdc` in tooling that shells out to it, without
pulling in a headless browser.

## Development

`nix flake check` builds the package and runs a smoke check that
exercises the built binaries over the interfaces callers use: the `mmdc`
rendering path, the flag set that keeps labels as native `<text>`,
source detection, and an LSP `initialize` handshake over stdio.

That check earns its place. Upstream is pre-1.0, and the 0.8.0-alpha.5
bump both silently dropped a binary (cargo `required-features` gating on
the `[[bin]]` target) and moved the CLI surface behind a subcommand.
Building the package alone would have caught neither.

`nix fmt` formats.

## Following upstream

A scheduled run (`.github/workflows/update.yml`, daily, or on demand
from the Actions tab) asks GitHub for merman's newest tag and, when it
is newer than the packaged version, moves the package to it, runs the
flake checks, and pushes the bump to `main` once they pass. Prereleases
count: the package has followed the 0.8.0 prereleases since the language
server needed them. A run whose checks fail pushes nothing and shows as
failed, and the package stays where it was until whatever broke is
fixed.

The same move by hand, from this directory:

```sh
nix run --inputs-from . 'nixpkgs#nix-update' -- --flake --version=unstable merman
```

## Binary cache

What `main` builds is pushed to the `clhodapp` cachix cache, signed with
its key, so a consumer at the same pins substitutes the compiled binary
instead of building it. That cache skips paths its upstreams already
hold, so using it means using them too:

| Substituter | Public key |
|---|---|
| `https://clhodapp.cachix.org` | `clhodapp.cachix.org-1:EW/0conxH0OQyo0o4ub/grdkFspholmQMSnQyj0vrZI=` |
| `https://nix-community.cachix.org` | `nix-community.cachix.org-1:mB9FSh9qf2dCimDSUo8Zy7bkq5CX+/rkCWyvRCYg3Fs=` |
| `https://numtide.cachix.org` | `numtide.cachix.org-1:2ps1kLBUWjxIneOy1Ik6cQjb41X0iXVXeHigGmycPPE=` |

The flake's `nixConfig` declares all three, so a direct `nix build` or
`nix flake check` here uses them once accepted: answer Nix's prompt, or
pass `--accept-flake-config`. A flake that consumes this one
as an input must add them to its own `extra-substituters` and
`extra-trusted-public-keys`; Nix does not carry an input's settings
into the consumer.
